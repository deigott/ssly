This is the showcase demonstration on what SSLy project is about.

SSLy project incorporates key encryption methods from `OpenSSL` including `MD5`, `SHA-256`, `BASE64`, `DES-ECB`, and `DES-CBC` for robust data security.

So I'm going to create a clean and secure implementation of the hashing and encrypting algorithm noted above.

To showcase my great programming skills, also my deep understanding of the cryptographic algorithms I will be coding this project using only pure and clean <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">C/C++</mark>.


```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>


/** @Brief Main function
*
*/
int    main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	return (0);
}
```
